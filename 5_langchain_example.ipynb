And OO databases (see the “OO Database Orientation” sidebar) are still minor players with solid but strictly niche markets. Sales of relational databases have grown considerably faster than the sales of OO databases, and annual worldwide RDBMS revenues are now about 50 times larger.\n\nRick Cattell, distinguished engineer at Sun Microsystems, indicated, “Object- oriented databases are doing just ﬁne, and the news of their demise is highly exag- gerated. While their market [share] isn’t as big, they continue to be used in areas like CAD (computer-aided design) and telecommunications, where RDBMSs are not well suited.”\n\nNeal Leavitt\n\nA couple of years ago, industry\n\nHowever, said Michael Stonebraker, chief technology ofﬁcer at Informix and an ORDBMS proponent and pioneer, “ODBMSs occupy a small niche market that has no broad appeal. The technology is in semi-rigor mortis, and ORDBMSs will corner the market within ﬁve years.”\n\nobservers touted object-oriented databases as a technology on the rise, well suited for the emerg- ing Internet age.\n\nThey said object-oriented database- management systems (ODBMSs) would soon become the primary database tech- nology, supplanting relational database- management systems (RDBMSs), which were not designed to handle the type of multimedia data frequently found on the Internet. As further evidence of this, they said the growth of intranets signaled a decline in the use of client-server net- works, on which most relational data- bases were used.\n\nDATABASE MARKETPLACE\n"}],"source":"query_text = \"Will object-oriented databases be commercially successful?\"\n\ndocs = docsearch.similarity_search(query_text)\n\nprint(docs[0].page_content)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"50d01b42-650e-4e1f-81fe-a151d6688013","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-02T08:38:30.574548Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-02T08:38:30.574183Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-02T08:38:35.689308Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-02T08:38:35.688313Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-02T08:38:30.574524Z"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"The document does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether object-oriented databases will be commercially successful.
